= IRB on a diet, for MacRuby / Ruby 1.9

The goal is to have a small and cleaned up version of IRB. Trimmed down to only
do the stuff I, and most people I know, actually use.

Trimming down the core code is done mainly by using Ripper, which comes with
Ruby 1.9, instead of shipping it's own parser etc.

Furthermore, this IRB version specifically targets MacRuby, for now, and allows
Cocoa development to be done from the command-line. Dietrb will automatically
override the normal runloop to be ran in a thread and start a NSRunLoop on the
main thread.

There's still lots to be done, but the ‘basic functionality’ as is now, should
not grow too much more. For now my things to-do are .irbrc support, completion,
and investigate what else people really really need. After that it's time to
polish.
