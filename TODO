* Make Context take a ‘driver’ again, because we do not always want to redirect $stdout, but still receive output from the context. Ie, result, exception etc. A situation where we don’t want to redirect $stdout is in a server app.
* Don't use load the output redirection lib by default (ie when using standard tty/readline)
* Write docs for using a as library. Probably right after creating a Cocoa client.
* Add specs for irb/driver/socket, and possibly for bin/dietrb
* Configurable history file? (:HISTORY_FILE) Configurable number of saved history lines? (:SAVE_HISTORY)
* Make sure the following formatters work: hirb, awesome_print, and looksee
* Make sure the majority of the utils in utility_belt work
* Possibly add copy-paste support as an ext
* Decide whether or not we need more control for colorizing which could be done with Ripper::SexpBuilder
